## Introduction
The Serch Backend Server is a critical component of the Serch platform, designed to handle user authentication, session management, and various backend functionalities. It serves as the backbone of the Serch ecosystem, facilitating seamless interactions between users, data, and services.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Provides robust authentication mechanisms for user login, signup, and password reset.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, including session creation, refreshing, validation, and revocation.
- **User Management**: Handles user profile management, including profile creation, update, and verification.
- **Token Generation**: Generates secure tokens, including OTP (One-Time Passwords) and refresh tokens.
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling to ensure system reliability and user feedback.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration with other services and components.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Framework**: Utilized for dependency injection, MVC architecture, and RESTful web services.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization features.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless authentication and session management.
- **Hibernate**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing user data.
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool for building and managing Java projects.
